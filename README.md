# Flight Parser

This script, `flight_parser.py`, is used to parse flight data.

## Command-Line Usage

The script accepts various command-line arguments to specify the data to be processed.

### Filtering by State

To filter flight data by a specific state, use the `--state` argument followed by the state's abbreviation.
